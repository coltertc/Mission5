        breathtaking views of the 12,000-foot Mount Timpanogos. The terrain is thoughtfully divided across <br />
        over 450 acres, featuring a mix of wide-open bowls and perfectly groomed runs that cater well to intermediate <br />
        skiers and families. For those seeking more adventure, the back mountain provides steep glades and <br />
        challenging chutes that remain relatively uncrowded even on busy weekends.

        Snowbird is renowned for its steep, challenging terrain and an average annual snowfall exceeding 500 <br />
        inches, making it a premier destination for expert skiers. The resort’s legendary "Greatest Snow on Earth" <br />

        under ten minutes. From the top, athletes can descend through the expansive Peruvian Gulch or traverse into <br /> 
        Mineral Basin, a massive sun-drenched bowl known for its pristine backcountry-style powder.
